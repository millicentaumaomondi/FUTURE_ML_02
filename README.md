# Sentiment Analysis

* We applied logistic regression, naivebayes, support vector classifier and neural network.
* We started by preprocessing the txt data then splitting it into train and test in the ratio 70:30.
* We used the [IMDB movie review dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) from kaggle.
* clone the repo and run the jupyter notebook file.
* The SVM classifier performed best even with further hyperparameter tuning with gridsearchCV.
